st.write("Buildings contribute to 38% of global emissions as per the UN Environmental Global Status Report 2020. Hence, it is crucial for us to make efforts to reduce energy consumption. Each buildingâ€™s energy usage is mentioned in its monthly bill. However, it is quite challenging to assess if this amount would be higher/lower than others or the set average (threshold) consumption value for say, the 2050 goal. This can be achieved using the benchmark data. To be specific, Seattle has State Policies to require all public, commercial, and multifamily buildings to complete the benchmarking report of energy consumption in the building. In this regard, this app can be used to identify energy efficient buildings to learn more about practices responsible for its efficiency and also to identify buildings that perform poorly. This will help the owners or other parties for further analysis and assess if the building must be retrofitted with newer green attributes like more energy efficient appliances, better heating/cooling systems, airtight construction, etc to reduce its energy consumption.")
